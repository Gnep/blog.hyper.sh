preview: Introducing Hyper.sh Frankfurt!

---

We know you guys have been waiting for this for a loooong time. So, without further ado, today we are excited to announce our expansion into Europe with the opening of our Frankfurt region.

The expansion is to accommodate the significant growth in our developer user base and requests from both EU and US based customers for a region in Europe to better serve them and their clients.

The Frankfurt region will provide the same exceptionally easy to use, highly efficient, and incredibly cost effective container cloud service that our users know and love. As with all our services, we make selecting which region your containers are deployed to as simple as possible: add a tag to your Docker command and you're in a different region! Users will also be able to monitor their resources across multiple regions from the web console.

The expansion into EU signifies a great milestone for us, and validates our approach in offering one of the most powerful and versatile yet simple Container-as-a-Service offerings in the market.

We encourage you to learn more about the new region [here](https://docs.hyper.sh/Introduction/region.html).

As always, Happy Hacking!

The Hyper Crew
