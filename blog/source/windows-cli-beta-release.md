preview: Docker is a revolutionary idea. Being application-centric, it disrupts our imagination of IT infrastructure, and Hyper_ is started with the idea of container-native cloud. Now, we are now very happy to announce that Hyper_ has come out of beta and is now generally available!

Hi,

We are happy to announce the beta release of Hyper_ CLI on Windows. It shares the same code base and feature set of other platforms, allowing you to easily deploy containers in Hyper_ cloud.

The installation instruction can be found [here](https://docs.hyper.sh/GettingStarted/install.html). Please note that this package on Windows is beta version, you can file a bug at [here](https://github.com/hyperhq/hypercli/issues) if you find any issue.

Happy Hacking,
The Hyper_ Crew
