In the first of a new series of user interviews, Charlie Offenbacher CTO of [thebookrocket.com](http://thebookrocket.com/) tells us why he chose [Hyper.sh](https://hyper.sh/) over first running his own Docker hosts, then Tutum (now Docker Cloud) and then Joyent.

[thebookrocket.com](http://thebookrocket.com/) is an amazing idea. Remember all those old college text books that you have stashed in the attic? You can now sell them easily and for a reasonable price. Or as they put it: _"It's like Kayak, but for books."_

We'd like to thank Charlie for spreading the word about Hyper.sh and you can look forward to another user interview in the coming days.

Would you like to share your Hyper.sh experiences with our community? Drop us a mail on [talk@hyper.sh](mailto:talk@hyper.sh)

Happy Hacking,

The Hyper.sh Crew
