In the second of a new series of user interviews, Conor Nash  from [conornash.com](http://conornash.com/), tells us how Hyper.sh helps him to scale his St.Louis based data science consultancy.

Conor explains that by handing over the operations work to Hyper.sh he can concentrate on running more value adding workloads for his clients: more than he could ever have achieved if his team were wrangling server clusters.

We'd like to thank Conor for spreading the word about Hyper.sh and his valuable feedback. If you're in the St. Louis area and need data science consulting, we suggest you get in touch. He really knows his stuff!
